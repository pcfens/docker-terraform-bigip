Terraform - BigIP
=================

A simple docker image with terraform installed along with Dealer.com's
[BigIP Terraform Provider](https://github.com/DealerDotCom/terraform-provider-bigip).

## Use

The image already has terraform installed (see tags for version information) with
support for BigIP using the iControlREST API.

An incredibly basic terraform file is located in /usr/local/share/terraform.
